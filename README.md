# Classifying Trisomic Mice
First, I completed a scikit-learn tutorial to expand my ML capabilities. Next, I tested my knowledge by 
completing a classification project based on a dataset from the UCI ML Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/342/mice+protein+expression). 
Ultimately, I aimed to determine whether ML models could accurately classify mice by treatment group using protein expression data.
